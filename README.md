# Database-Design
A good database design is crucial for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't start building a house without the benefit of a blueprint, you need to think about how your data will be stored beforehand. Taking the time to design a database saves time and frustration later on, and a well-designed database ensures ease of access and retrieval of information. While choosing a design, a lot of considerations have to be accounted for. In this course, you'll learn how to process, store, and organize data in an efficient way. You'll see how to structure data through normalization and present your data with views. Finally, you'll learn how to manage your database and all of this will be done on a variety of datasets from book sales, car rentals, to music reviews.
